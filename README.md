This repository includes sample metadata, code, and intermediate output from analyses to reproduce the results reported in the manuscript **A major effect locus involved in migration timing is shared by pink and sockeye salmon** (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.30.587279v1). The figures and tables in the manuscript can created following the outline in the file *SalmonRunTiming_Manuscript.md* within the scripts directory. These analyses were performed on a high performance cluster, but should be adaptable with minimal effort, to conform to most any system specifications.
